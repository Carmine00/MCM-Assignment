# Modeling and Control of Manipulators - Assignments

Development of Matlab scripts at the University of Genoa in the academic year 2022/2023 during the Modeling and Control of Manipulators course, regarding geometric and kinematic modeling of serial manipulators.

## Description
In each folder it is possible to find the Matlab scripts and a technical report that describe the results obtained for each exercise solved of the assignment.
<br>
The first assignment focuses on the geometric fundamentals and algorithmic tools underlying any robotics application. 
The concepts of transformation matrix, orientation matrix and the equivalent representations of orientation matrices (Equivalent angle-axis representation, Euler Angles and Quaternions) are studied.

In the second assignment the analysis of a specific manipulator geometry and direct kinematics was carried out.

The third assignment develops the definition of the Jacobian matrix to further study the Panda robot of FrankaEmika and solve inverse kinematics problem.
